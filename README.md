# EmberJS with Laravel API Project Walk-through 
This documentation will walk you through configuring a front-end web application and it's back-end API data resource. 

## Step 1: Clone Repositories
There are two repositories to download for our project - one for the front-end application and one for the back-end API.  

+ From your development folder, run the following to clone the project repositories:  
    * `git clone https://github.com/pitchinnate/tweeter.git` 
    * `git clone https://github.com/kuatsure/tweeter-client.git` 
    * You should now have two folders: 
    ~~~
       /tweeter 
       /tweeter-client 
    ~~~

## Step 2: Install required tools and they're are up to date:  
### MacOS 

+ For local development, we'll use **[Homebrew package manager](http://brew.sh/)** 
+ After **Homebrew** is installed, run the following from the `/tweeter-client` folder: 
    * `brew update` 
    * `brew upgrade node` 
+ Now we want to install the Ember command line interface (CLI)
    * `npm install -g ember-cli` 

### Windows 

## 3: Install the Ember command line interface (CLI) 
The **EmberCLI** tool allows you to manage the EmberJS framework from a command line. 

### MacOS 
+ From the `/tweeter-client` folder, run the following:
    * `npm install -g ember-cli`
